FOODSHALA WEBSITE
So as per the task given by Internshala I have completed the foodshala website with all of the necessary features. The steps which should be followed to run my code are-
1) First of all you should populate the database- create a new table foodcourt in mysql. Import the file "foodcourt.sql" script in the restaurant folder. After that you run the script and the database will populate with four tables and values accordingly.

2) As the next step you should run the "index.php" file using local host created by XAMPP OR WAMP by localhost/food/index.php with that the index page of the website will be loaded with all of the tempting dishes.

3)The project will be as follows: the Navbar consists of home, register and login on the right side. Register has again a dropdown menu for register as customer or restaurant. Login consists of a pop up which has two options to login as a customer or restaurant(both register and login has all the functionalities as mentioned in the assignment and are running properly).

4)When we go further we can see all of the dishes and cuisines.

5) You should connect your system to the internet before running because the index.php file as it contains bootstrap and jQuery which needs an internet connection
